                  <p>
                    Welcome to Smart Home. These Terms and Conditions govern
                    your use of our website and the purchase and delivery of
                    products. By placing an order, you agree to be bound by
                    these terms.
                  </p>

                  <h3>2. Ordering Process</h3>
                  <p>
                    All orders are subject to availability and confirmation of
                    the order price. You must provide accurate and complete
                    information when placing an order. We reserve the right to
                    refuse or cancel any order at our discretion.
                  </p>

                  <h3>3. Pricing and Payment</h3>
                  <p>
                    All prices are listed in Hong Kong dollar and include
                    applicable taxes unless stated otherwise. Payment must be
                    made in full at the time of purchase using accepted payment

                  <h3>4. Shipping and Delivery</h3>
                  <p>
                    We deliver to China, Hong Kong and Singapore. Delivery times
                    are estimates and may vary due to external factors. Shipping
                    fees are calculated at checkout and depend on location and
                    delivery method. Risk of loss and title for items pass to
                    you upon delivery.
                  </p>

                    You may return eligible products within 7 days of receipt
                    for a refund or exchange. Returned items must be unused, in
                    original packaging, and accompanied by proof of purchase.
                    Refunds will be processed to the original payment method
                    within 5 business days. Shipping costs for returns are the
                    responsibility of the customer unless the item is defective
                    or incorrect.
                  </p>
